# Week 6 Infrastructure Track Spark Training



## Usage

To launch the spark and iceberg docker containers, run:

```bash
make up
```

Then, you should be able to access a Jupyter notebook at `localhost:8888`.

The first notebook to be able to run is the `event_data_pyspark.ipynb` inside the `notebooks` folder.
